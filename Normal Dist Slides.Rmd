## Normal Distribution Simulation  
Purpose:
This application was made to help young students understand the following attributes of random sampling by seeing their effects change in real time.

- Central Limit theory 
- Standard Deviation
- Central tenancy around the mean

## Controls

- Sample Size (1 - 100,000)
- Standard Deviation (1 - 250)
- Mean (1 - 250)  

## Method used for histogram generation  
The inputs taken from the sliders are then entered into a normal distribution by using the   `rnorm()` function:    
`normdist <- rnorm(num_samp, mean= means, sd= stddev)`   

The histogram plot was created with the following code, providing 100 breaks of separation. 

`hist(normdist, breaks = 100, col = 'skyblue', border = 'grey') #plot`
